	<H1 class="content_h1" id="RightClickContextMenu">Right Click Context Menu</h1>
	<p class="content_p1">The Right Click Context Menu is the main work horse of the application. Through it you will add and edit tree-view items that will define the Hot Keys and Speech Recognition behavior for all your applications and games.</p>

	<H2 class="content_h2"id="RightClickContextMenuHowToUse">How To Use</h2>
	<p class="content_p2">Hitting Ctrl+Enter or Right Clicking on a tree-view item will pop up a menu that will display a list of actions to perform.</p>
	<p class="content_p2">Some menu items will be enabled while other won't. It all depends on the context of the tree-view item clicked (hence the name).</p>
	<p class="content_p2">Hitting enter in the menu will trigger the selected item. If no selected item is set, the bold menu item will run by default.</p>
	<p class="content_p2">Double clicking on the tree-view item will trigger the Edit menu item.</p>
	<p class="content_p2">Below is the list of all the menu actions and what they do.</p>
	
	
	<img class="content_sepline" src="../images/sepline.png">
	
	<H2 class="content_h2" id="RightClickContextMenuAddApplication">Add Application</h2>
	<p class="content_p2">This will launch the <u>Select Application Interface</u> which will allow you to add an application to your list of monitored application under which you will later define the hot key and speech recognition structure.</p>
	<p class="content_p2">Applications can be added under the <u>Applications and Games</u> tree-view item or any Group that are off of that root item.</p>
	<p class="content_p2">Once an application is added, you can edit its settings via the <u>Edit</u> menu which will launch the <u>Select Application Interface</u>.</p>
	<p class="content_p2">Windows 10 Apps will share a single <u>Windows Apps</u> root Application item under which any new Windows 10 App you add will be created in the form of a Window Context item.</p>
		
	<img class="content_sepline" src="../images/sepline.png">
	
	<H2 class="content_h2" id="RightClickContextMenuAddCommand">Add Command</h2>
	<p class="content_p2">This will create a New <u>Command Action</u> item and launch the <u>Command Action Interface</u> which will allow you define a hot key and speech recognition phrase along with the code to execute when the action is performed.</p>
	
	<img class="content_sepline" src="../images/sepline.png">
	<H2 class="content_h2" id="RightClickContextMenuAddContext">Add Context</h2>
	<p class="content_p2">This will create a New <u>Context Action</u> item and launch the <u>Context Action Interface</u> which will allow you to segregate speech and hot key detection by what can be defined as exploratory context where a series of actions results in digging in the command structure in so that you can contextualize what actions are possible depending on passed user actions.</p>
	
	<img class="content_sepline" src="../images/sepline.png">
	<H2 class="content_h2" id="RightClickContextMenuAddWindowContext">Add Window Context</h2>
	<p class="content_p2">This will create a New <u>Window Context Action</u> item and launch the <u>Window Context Action Interface</u> which will allow you to segregate speech and hot key detection by specific active windows or active controls in the application and so that you can contextualize what actions are possible under which dialog box the application presents the user, for example.</p> 
	
	<img class="content_sepline" src="../images/sepline.png">
	<H2 class="content_h2" id="RightClickContextMenuAddGroup">Add Group</h2>
	<p class="content_p2">This will create a New <u>Group</u> item and launch the <u>Group Interface</u> which will allow you to structure the tree-view in a way that makes sense to you. Since Command actions are sorted, searched and prioritized alphabetically, Groups also help defining what actions can be processed first, specifically in the case were a Window Context that targets a specific window with specific data needs to be processed before a similar Window Context that catches a more generic version of that same window.</p> 
	
	<img class="content_sepline" src="../images/sepline.png">
	<H2 class="content_h2" id="RightClickContextMenuAddResource">Add Resource</h2>
	<p class="content_p2">This will create a New <u>File Resource</u> item by launching a file explorer where you will select a (small) file like a wav file to include in the hot key rules.... Such files are useful to add extra features like sound when an action performs... The system should not be abused by adding files that are too large...</p> 
	
	<img class="content_sepline" src="../images/sepline.png">
	<H2 class="content_h2" id="RightClickContextMenuEdit">Edit</h2>
	<p class="content_p2">This will edit the item selected allowing you to make changes to it.</p> 
	
	<img class="content_sepline" src="../images/sepline.png">
	<H2 class="content_h2" id="RightClickContextMenuCut">Cut (Prep for Move)</h2>
	<p class="content_p2">This will flag the item or group/structure (and all items underneath) for a possible subsequent Paste-Move action.</p> 
	
	<img class="content_sepline" src="../images/sepline.png">
	<H2 class="content_h2" id="RightClickContextMenuCopy">Copy (Prep for Clone)</h2>
	<p class="content_p2">This will flag the item or group/structure (and all items underneath) for a possible subsequent Paste-Copy action.</p> 

	<img class="content_sepline" src="../images/sepline.png">
	<H2 class="content_h2" id="RightClickContextMenuPaste">Paste (Copy/Move To)</h2>
	<p class="content_p2">This will perform the copy or move function for the item or structure that was previously flagged by the Cut or Copy functions... to the selected location.</p> 
	<p class="content_p2">The cut copy paste feature is a little unconventional but you get used to it.</p> 
	<p class="content_p2">Note that this item will be enabled only if the content that was flagged for copy/cut is compatible with the item or structure you are pasting to. You cannot paste an Application Item under a Window Context for example.</p> 
	<p class="content_p2">IMPORTANT: You may need to use the <U>Scan For Issues</U> menu after a Paste action in order to fix any parenting issues that may have resulted from the action.</p> 


	<img class="content_sepline" src="../images/sepline.png">
	<H2 class="content_h2" id="RightClickContextMenuSaveToFile">Save to File</h2>
	<p class="content_p2">This will save the selected item or structure to file so you can share your setup with other people.</p> 
	<p class="content_p2">Depending on the content you are saving there are 3 possible file types that can be generated....
		<dl class="dl_p2">
		  <dt>simphks</dt>
		  <dd>Simple Hot Key Script file - contains items or groups which can be imported under an application. This is useful for saving features you re-use often.</dd>
		  <dt>exehks</dt>
		  <dd>Executable Hot key Script - contains one application or a group of applications which can be imported back under the Applications and Games root item (or a group underneath it). This is basically the way to share your scripts for specific games.</dd>
		  <dt>appshks</dt>
		  <dd>Applications (and games) Hot Key Script - contains a full Hot Key Script definition file. Importing this would replace your current file completely.</dd>
		</dl>
	</p> 
	<img class="content_sepline" src="../images/sepline.png">
	<H2 class="content_h2" id="RightClickContextMenuLoadFromFile">Load From File</h2>
	<p class="content_p2">Loads a file that was previous saved (see Save above).</p> 
	<p class="content_p2">You will be warned if you are trying to import a file type that is incompatible with the target item. See Save above for where things are imported.</p> 
    <p class="content_p2">IMPORTANT: You may need to use the <U>Scan For Issues</U> menu after importing a file in order to fix any parenting issues that may have resulted from the action.</p> 
    <p class="content_p2">IMPORTANT: You may need to re-assign applications via the <U>Application Interface</u> for application rules you import as they may not be at the same location recorded in the file.</p> 
	
    <img class="content_sepline" src="../images/sepline.png">
	<H2 class="content_h2" id="RightClickContextMenuScanForIssues">Scan For Issues</h2>
	<p class="content_p2">This will scan the structures for incompatibilities such as duplicate items and function names and repair broken parenting hierarchy.</p> 
	
	<img class="content_sepline" src="../images/sepline.png">
	<H2 class="content_h2" id="RightClickContextMenuDelete">Delete</h2>
	<p class="content_p2">This will delete the selected item and all its children items if applicable.</p>
